a,b,c,d interim releases and adds a few new features (details at the

<h2 id="X2">Accessing the PRS remotely from an iPad</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s face it, lugging a notebook or a netbook around while you&#8217;re on
the move just on the off chance you may need to access your data
doesn&#8217;t really cut it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A few weeks back we were asked if an Apple iPad could be used to
remotely access the PRS, we already had an iPad 2 but had not really
thought about using it for remote access. I set about evaluating iPad
remote access apps and to my surprise found that, with the right app,
remote access from an iPad is surprisingly usable (<a href="http://srackham.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/using-an-ipad-to-access-remote-windows-desktops/">see my blog
on the subject</a>).</p></div>

<h3 id="_q_amp_a">Q &amp; A</h3>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
What if I don&#8217;t have an iPad?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
You don&#8217;t need an iPad for remote access, for example the free
<a href="http://support.jumpdesktop.com/entries/20097387-jump-desktop-viewer-for-pc">Jump
Desktop Viewer</a> allows you to use a Windows PC in place of an iPad for
the remote access client&#32;&#8212;&#32;an option if you&#8217;re wanting to dip your
toes in the water before deciding.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Isn&#8217;t setting up secure remote access through my office firewall tricky?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Normally yes, but if you use a remote access program with an
auto-connect feature like <a href="http://jumpdesktop.com/">Jump Desktop</a> it&#8217;s easy (<a href="http://srackham.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/using-an-ipad-to-access-remote-windows-desktops/#X1">see my
blog on the subject</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Don&#8217;t I need an iPad with the 3G option to use a mobile data connection?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
No, not if you have a mobile phone that supports WiFi tethering. WiFi
tethering turns your phone into your own private wireless hotspot, in
most new Android phones turning tethering on is a simple one-click
option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
How can I keep a lid on mobile data costs?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Remote access typically uses less data than Web browsing but mobile
data is expensive in New Zealand, so only use it when you have to and
if, for example, you&#8217;re at home connect the iPad to the Internet over
your home WiFi connection. <a href="http://srackham.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/keeping-a-lid-on-mobile-data/">I blogged about this recently</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Is it true that remote access won&#8217;t work on a PC running Windows Home edition?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Microsoft does not bundle an RDP server with <em>Windows Home</em> editions
so you need to install an alternative. <a href="http://jumpdesktop.com/">Jump Desktop</a> will optionally
install a VNC server on Windows Home PCs, but a version of Windows
with built-in RDP is preferable (I discuss this <a href="http://srackham.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/using-an-ipad-to-access-remote-windows-desktops/#X2">in my blog</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
What happens if my desktop PC is powered off?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Your desktop PC has to be powered on to access it remotely so you do
need to leave your PC on and don&#8217;t enable the <em>Hibernate</em> or <em>Sleep</em>
power options.  Most PCs are capable of being turned on by a remote
command over the Internet, but getting this configured and working is
outside the scope of this newsletter.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Can I use an Android tablet?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
We haven&#8217;t evaluated an Android tablet yet (we&#8217;re waiting for the
market to mature a little) so we don&#8217;t have any recommendations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
So now I&#8217;ve got a tablet I don&#8217;t need a desktop PC, right?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Not so fast, tablets are content consumers not content creators. The
tablet on-screen keyboard and small screen is OK for casual input and
browsing but is not suitable for ongoing data entry or document
creation.

<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a simple set
of rules for formatting text to generate nicely formatted HTML.
Although the PRS has always had a Markdown option for composing HTML
formatted emails, it has not been very accessible because you needed a
different HTML mail signature to use it. We&#8217;ve lifted this restriction
and added a <em>Use Markdown</em> option to the mail composition form.</p></div>
