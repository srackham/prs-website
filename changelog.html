<p>
The <em>Mail Signatures catalog</em> is automatically initialised when a
  <code>mail_template.html</code> file is found for the first time in the

<h2 id="_version_8_1_9_2016_02_26">Version 8.1.9 (2016-02-26)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist"><div class="title">Additions and changes</div><ul>
<li>
<p>
PRS personnel drop-down lists are now automatically updated when a
  new person has been added on another user&#8217;s PC&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;previously these
  checks were only performed when the PRS was restarted. This feature
  eliminates the need to manually update using the PRS <em>Records&#8594;Update
  Form Lists</em> menu command.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <em>Personnel Summary</em> form is now synchronised with the
  <em>Personnel</em> form so you can open them both side-by-side and the
  <em>Personnel Summary</em> will automatically display the summary of the
  person on the <em>Personnel</em> from.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A <em>Remember form locations</em> checkbox option has been added to the
  <em>Appearance</em> tab of the <em>Tools&#8594;Options&#8230;</em> dialog. This option
  causes the PRS to remember the size and location of resizable
  forms. This new feature allows you to create your own custom screen
  layouts which will be restored when the forms are next opened (handy
  if you have a large high resolution display).
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
If you want to open a form in it&#8217;s default location then hold down
    the <em>Ctrl</em> key while you open it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you want all forms to always open in their default locations
    then untick the <em>Remember form locations</em> option.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Expenses and Vacancy Publication forms are now resizable and
  floating (previously fixed sized modal).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To help distinguish between candidates with the same last and first
  names, the <em>Personnel ID</em> now appears in the <em>New Candidate</em>
  personnel drop-down list.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="ulist"><div class="title">Bug fixes</div><ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>FIXED</em>: The <em>All</em> option no longer appears in the <em>Action</em>
  drop-down list when you add a candidate activity (<em>All</em> is not a
  valid choice in this context).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>FIXED</em>: Sometimes the PRS <em>Help&#8594;Check for PRS Updates&#8230;</em> menu
  command would incorrectly report the PRS was up to date.

<li>
<p>
<em>FIXED</em>: Sometimes the <em>Sheets</em> command on the Vacancies form
  generated an expression evaluation error.
</p>
</li>

  vacancy.
</p>
</li>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Restore old saved value when <em>Esc</em> key is pressed.

The PRS now comes bundled with it&#8217;s own spell checker&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;previous

The <em>Consultant Billings</em> reports are now invoice centric (each row

An <em>Archive Old Notes</em> old Notes command has been added to the
